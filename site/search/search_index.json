See the documentation for the options for fastqc.    gsnap \nHere we give an example of two sections as we need to\npass the index information to the aligner    options \n Specify program options here. In this example we\n specify the following   \n  \n    \n      -d \n      The genome index for GSNAP \n    \n    \n      -s \n      and the splicesites file location for GSNAP. \n    \n    \n   The format is exactly that as to what you would specify on the command line for the program    ```bash\n-d Ensembl_mus_GRCm38.p5_rel89\n-s Mus_musculus.GRCm38.89.splicesites.iit  See the documentation for the GSNAP program for more options\n\n- **job\\_params**  \nThis section specifies parameters for job submission such as memory, number of cores etc\n    - ncpus: 16\n\n    - mem: 40000\n\n    - time: 60\n\n- **qualimap\\_rnaseq**  \nRun the qualimap module for RNAseq with the **default** settings\n\n\nThe final YAML control file should look as below to run a test example. Only modify the parts\nthat are highlighted below to fill in your ownm values.\n\n```yaml\n    bioproject: Project_test_localhost\n    experiment: rnaseq_pilot\n    sample_manifest:\n      fastq_file: /users/:bluetext:`username/sample_manifest_min.csv`\n      metadata:\n    run_parms:\n      conda_command: source activate /gpfs/runtime/opt/conda/envs/cbc_conda_test\n      work_dir: /gpfs/scratch/ user/test_workflow \n      log_dir: logs\n      paired_end: False\n      local_targets: False\n      db: sqlite\n      db_loc:  :memory: \n      saga_host: localhost\n      ssh_user:  ccv username \n      saga_scheduler: slurm\n      gtf_file: /gpfs/data/cbc/cbcollab/ref_tools/Ensembl_hg_GRCh37_rel87/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.87.gtf\n    workflow_sequence:\n      fastqc: default\n      gsnap:\n        options:\n          -d: Ensembl_Homo_sapiens_GRCh37\n          -s: Ensembl_Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.87.splicesites.iit\n        job_params:\n          ncpus: 16\n          mem: 40000\n        time: 60\n      qualimap_rnaseq: default\n      htseq-count: default",
