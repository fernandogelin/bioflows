## 3 Wrappers

This section provides an overview of all the bioinformatic programs
that currenlty have wrappers implemented internally in BioFlows. For
each tool all the options are shown and any of these options can be
provided under options in the YAML file.

### 3.1 Fastqc


Fastqc is a java program to undertake QC for fastq reads produced by
NGS, primarily illumina sequencing. More details on the tool as well
as the documentation from the original developers is available from the
[Fastqc](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/)
website. The following options are
currently available through the fastqc program wrapper in the bioflows package

```bash
fastqc -h
```
