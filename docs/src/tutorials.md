## 2 BioFlows Tutorials


This section provides an overview of how to run pre-defined workflows using
the **bioflows** package. The tutorials are based on presuming that the analysis is
conducted on the Brown [CCV](https://web1.ccv.brown.edu) compute cluster, to use on other systems please
check the installation instructions for setting up your environment. Currently, we have implemented an RNA-seq
workflow using the GSNAP RNAseq aligner. This will be updated as new
workflows and enhnacements are made to the BioFlows package.
